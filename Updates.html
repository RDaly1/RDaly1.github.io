<center><h1>Updates</h1></center>
<center><p>The purpose of these updates were to keep track of our progress and benchmark anything relevant that may be of use to the project. This was done on a bi-weekly basis
in order to provide enough time for everyone to gather any significant research that may be of use. <strong>Note: This schedule starts from 09/09/22 and is updated bi-weekly. However in some cases, there may be some discrepancies</strong></p></center>

	<li>09/09/22 - Introduction to Online Activism: Online activism is the use of the internet and digital platforms to advocate for both social and political causes. With the rise of social media, online activism has become an incredibly powerful tool for individuals
		and groups to raise awareness and make their voices heard. But what are the impacts of online activism in both society and in politics? In this series of blog posts, we will explore how online activism is changing the way we engage with politics and the ways in which it's shaping the political landscape.</li>
	</li>

	<li>23/09/22 - The Power of Online Activism: Online activism has the power to reach and affect a large number of people in quite a short amount of time. Platforms like Twitter and Instagram allow individuals and grous to share information, organise events, and mobilize people around a cause. This can be particularly powerful for marginalised or underrepresented groups who may not have the resources to organise traditional campaigns.
		Additionally, online activism allows for the creation of virtual communities where people can come together to support each other and share information and resources</li>
	<li>07/10/22 - The Impact of Online Activism on Political Campaigns: Online activism has had a significant impact on political campaigns. Candidates and campaignes are now using digital platforms to reach voters and mobilize supporters. Social media is being used to create personalised messages and targeted advertising, which can be incredibly effective in
		reaching specific demographics. Additionally, online activism has given raise to the use of crowdfunding platforms, which allow campaigns to raise money from a large number of small donors. This has the potential to give more power to the people in how the campaign finance is more democratized.</li>

	<li>21/10/22 - The Role of Online Activism in Social Movements: Online activism has played a significant role in the rise of social movements in recent years. The Black Lives Matter movement, for example, was largely organised and mobilized through social media. This allowed for the movement to reach a global audience and gain support from people all over the world. Additionally, online activism has given rise to the use of hashtags and viral campaigns, which have helped to raise awareness and bring
	attention to social issues.</li>

	<li>21/10/22 - The Challenges of Online Activism: Online Activism is not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the potential for online harrassment and hate speech. Online activists often face backlash from those who disagree with their views and can be subject to harrassment and threats. Additionally, the spread of misinformation and fake news on social media can make it difficult for activists to get their message out. Finally, the speed and ease of online activism can sometimes lead to a lack of accountability and a lack of follow through on the part of the activists</li>
	
	<li>04/11/22 - The role of Online Petitions in Modern Activism: Online petitions have become a powerful tool for modern activism, providing individuals with an easy and accessible way to make their voices heard on a variety of issues. The widespread availability of the internet and social media platforms has made it possible for people to come together and gather support for causes they care about, regardless of geographic location. With just a few clicks, anyone can sign a petition and share it with their network, potentially reaching millions of people.
		
		In recent years, online petitions have been used to advocate for political and social change, raise awareness about important issues, and put pressure on decision-makers to take action. While online petitions are not a panacea for solving all of society's problems, they have become an increasingly important tool for people to engage in activism and bring attention to issues that matter to them.</li>
	<li>18/11/22 - Examining the Effectiveness of Online Activism in Comparison to Traditional Activism: Examining the effectiveness of online activism in comparison to traditional forms of activism is a complex issue that requires a nuanced examination of various factors.
		 On one hand, online activism has the advantage of reach, as it allows for rapid spreading of information and the ability to mobilize large numbers of people with relative ease. On the other hand, traditional forms of activism, such as protests and demonstrations, can have a greater impact due to their physical presence and the potential for media coverage. However, both online and traditional activism can complement each other and be used together to achieve greater impact.
		 Ultimately, the effectiveness of any form of activism is determined by its ability to bring about real change, and it is important to evaluate campaigns based on the outcomes they achieve, rather than the methods they employ. </li>
		
	<li>02/12/22 - The Role of Influencers in Online Activism and their impact on Political Decisions: Influencers play a significant role in online activism, using their large platforms and following to raise awareness and mobilize support for various causes. Influencers can help bring attention to important issues and amplify the voices of marginalized communities, often reaching a wider audience than traditional activist groups.
		 Their engagement can also increase the visibility of an issue and put pressure on decision-makers to take action. However, the impact of influencer activism on political decisions is not always beneficial. While influencer activism can bring attention to important issues, it can also oversimplify complex problems and lead to shallow or misleading narratives. Ultimately, the impact of influencer activism on political decisions depends on a variety of factors, including the influencer's credibility, the issue in question, and the political landscape. 
		 While influencer activism can play a role in creating change, it is important to recognize its limitations and to engage in a broader range of activism strategies to bring about meaningful and lasting change.</li>
	
	<li>16/12/22 -  The Impact of Online Activism on Traditional Media and their Role in Shaping Public Opinion: The impact of online activism on traditional media has been significant, with traditional media outlets now facing increased competition from digital platforms in terms of shaping public opinion. Online activism has enabled individuals to bypass traditional gatekeepers and share their perspectives directly with a wide audience.
		As a result, traditional media outlets are now more likely to cover stories and issues that have already gained traction online, as they compete to keep up with the rapid pace of information dissemination. However, traditional media still plays a critical role in shaping public opinion by providing context, analysis, and perspective on the issues that are being raised by online activism. 
		By working in conjunction with online activism, traditional media can help to deepen public understanding of important issues and bring about meaningful and lasting change. However, it is important to recognize that the relationship between online activism and traditional media is complex and ever-evolving, and that both must continue to adapt to changing technological and political landscapes to remain relevant and impactful.</li>
	
	<li>30/12/22 - The Impact of Online Activism on Marginalized Communities and their ability to have Their Voices Heard: Online activism has had a positive impact on marginalized communities, giving them a platform to have their voices heard and amplifying their messages in ways that were not previously possible. By bypassing traditional gatekeepers and reaching a wider audience through social media and other digital platforms, marginalized communities are able to raise awareness and advocate for their causes more effectively. 
		Online activism has also enabled marginalized communities to connect with one another and build solidarity, strengthening their collective power to bring about change. However, it is important to acknowledge that not all marginalized communities have equal access to technology and digital platforms, and that the impact of online activism can be limited for those who are excluded from these spaces. 
		Additionally, online activism can sometimes be co-opted or undermined by larger and more powerful interests, and it is important for marginalized communities to be cautious and strategic in their use of digital technologies to ensure that their voices are truly being heard and their needs are being addressed. </li>

	<li>13/01/23 - The Role of Anonymity in Online Activism and its impact on Personal Safety: Anonymity has played a significant role in online activism, allowing individuals to participate in activism and express their views without fear of retaliation. Anonymity can provide a sense of safety and protection for activists, particularly in countries where political and social views can be met with censorship, persecution, or even violence.
		By concealing their identity, activists are able to share sensitive information, participate in controversial discussions, and engage in activism without fear of consequences.

	</li>
	<li>27/01/23 - Conclusions: Online Activism has had a significant impact on society and modern politics. It has allowed for the mobilization of large numbers of people around social and political causes and has given rise to new forms of political campaigning. However, it's important to recognise the challenges that come with online activism and to work towards creating a safe and inclusive online space for activists.
		Ultimately, online activism ahs the potential to be a powerful tool for change and it will be important to continue to explore it's impacts in the years to come.</li>
