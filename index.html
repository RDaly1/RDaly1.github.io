<center><h1>Introduction</h1></center>
<p>The intended purpose of our project was to explore the impact that online activism movements have on real-world
issues in today's society. Now more than ever, online activism can be a vital tool in spreading information and raising awareness
of potential societal injustices and issues. However, there also poses a danger in using online activism as an instrument of political influence.
Essentially this is what this project seeks to explore.</p>

<p>Our work was done in methods of segmentation, i.e: research was conducted and updated on a bi-weekly basis, followed by presenting it in a way
that was clear and concise for any reader, in the form of this website.</p>
</p>
<h2>Online Activism: The Benefits and The Consequences</h2>
<P>Online Activism is one of the most common forms of spreading information, raising awareness, and organising events nowadays. However, as much potential as there 
is for good, there's also a huge potential for danger and problems.
Online activism can be used to maximise the efficiency of political movements, with the internet serving as a means to stay in contact with people from all around the world.
It's also an incredibly powerful tool in areas where conventional methods of activism are prohibited, as it democratizes the entire concept of activism in general, allowing anyone to partaking
in activism movements.
</P>
<P>However, misinformation is rampant on the internet, which often leads to distrust and cynicism, disencouraging people from taking part in activism movements. Alongside that, there's 
also major issues regarding privacy, as well as the lack of protection for children and potentially triggering content.
</P>
<p>here's also the major issue of Performative Activism, otherwise known as Slacktivism, in which people use online activism as a tool to benefit themselves, rather 
	than to actually benefit the respective issue. One of the prime examples found in our key studies was the "#BlackoutTuesday", in which millions of people posted a black square on their respective social media platforms,
	as a way of showing solidarity to the Black Lives Matter movement. This however, did not benefit the cause in any significant manner and was primarily used as a way to improve one's social repuation.</p>
